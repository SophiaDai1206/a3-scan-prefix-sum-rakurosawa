I like how you commented on your code, which makes it easy for me to understand your code. 
The codes look good to me and it also makes sense. In the recursive prefix one, you used three arrays which are in shared memories for the dynamic swap. 
It’s an innovative way to do that. 

The graph is pretty and I like how to not only use the int input array to test the run time but also the float input array. 
I didn’t even realize that and by looking at your work, I learnt a lot. Great work!
